# ios-app-xilophone
xilophone simple

This is a project from the Udemy iOS 13 & Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp done on XCode 14.3 and iMac running Big Sur.
In the course this Xylophone project was pre-made. I took the task of recreating the whole thing from cratch to familliarize myself with the new XCode version.
